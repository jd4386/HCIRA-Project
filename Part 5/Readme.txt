Objective check:

a. The same code from Part 3 was changed for user count at lines 56 and 85 in testing.py for current dataset. Also, speed variable was removed since the current dataset has no such factor. The iterations were set to 10 for faster testing.

b. Log file is outputted in the same format as required in Part 3 and the total average accuracy is calculated at the end of the log file. The total average accuracy is 0.98.

c. The heatmaps and feature data are generated by running a user independent analysis and the iutput files are attached with the submission.

d. Two insights were made from the heatmaps.
    1. Users have a divergence in the strokes that were open ended and had long length such as the longer end of an arrow or a check.
    2. Deviations were noticed in curved strokes such as the full circles and arcs of pigtails.
