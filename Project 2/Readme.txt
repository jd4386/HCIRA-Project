Project 2

Objective:

- We have implemented a $N recognizer that was designed to recognize gestures with multiple strokes. We have used the Javascript code that was provided in the original paper as reference and implemeted the Python version.

- Some changes have been done to the Project 1 GUI to accommodate Project 2 also. This makes both of them available in the same application integration $1 and $N recognizers.

- Datset generation code is also integrated similarly. A change in the backend flag would result in generating a dataset for different recognizer.

- The recognition algorithm hasn't been altered although minimal changes were made to accommodate the new recognizer function call.

- Offline testing was performed on both unistroke and multistroke datasets as done in the $N paper.
